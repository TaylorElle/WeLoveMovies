# WeLoveMovies

Project aimed at setting up a database and building out specific routes so that users can gain access to data about movies, theaters, and reviews. 


**General tasks**
Your app.js file and server.js file are correctly configured, with your app.js file exporting the application created from Express.
You use the cors package so that requests from the frontend can correctly reach the backend.
If a request is made to a route that doesn't exist, the server returns a 404 error.
If a request is made to a route that exists but the HTTP method is wrong, the server returns a 405 error.
All of your routes respond with the appropriate status code and use a data key in the response.

**Project rubric**
All the tests are passing in Qualified.
The migrations can be correctly run and rolled back.
The seed command can be run multiple times and work correctly.
A response is included for Method Not Allowed.
The cors package is included.
The entire application is deployed and working.
